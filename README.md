CTI - 110 Repository. A brief description of my Github account would be that it's a new account. Not much going on at the moment. I'm assuming we'll be using more as the semester progresses.
A brief description of my repository that I created would be the same as my Github account. It's new, pretty empty. I see the tabs that we read about in the lesson. The Branch tab, the repository tab, and also a fetch origin tab. At the moment I'm not sure of it's purpose or function but I anticipate that we will find out soon enough.
The steps I took to clone the repository on to my computer was pretty straight forward. I just went to file, clicked on clone repository, chose the destination and created a folder.
